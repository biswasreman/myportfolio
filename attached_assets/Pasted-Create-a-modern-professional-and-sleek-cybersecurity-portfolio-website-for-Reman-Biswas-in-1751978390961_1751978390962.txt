Create a modern, professional, and sleek **cybersecurity portfolio website** for **Reman Biswas** in a **dark hacker theme**.

Use **hacker-style monospace fonts** like "Fira Code", "Ubuntu Mono", or "Hack", and make headings look like **Linux terminal commands** (e.g. `cat about.txt`, `sudo whoami`, `ls skills/`, etc.).
